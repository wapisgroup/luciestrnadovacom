    "details": "Yesterday I played in my first tournament of the British Junior Golf Tour. It was a IMGA JWC Regional Qualifier in High Wycombe. The warm-up went pretty well but with the approaching tee time the wind picked up and it started raining and it rained throughout the whole game. I wasn’t really lucky this time but still finished second and qualified to the BJGT IMG Academy Junior World Championship Qualifier Final which will be in the Park Hill GC in Loughborough on 8th October."
